# AIQA-004: React Runtime Validator Case Study

## Title

**Detecting Post-Mount React Hook Corruption in Lovable Sandbox Environments**

## Summary

A React application that worked locally and in production exhibited unexpected runtime corruption inside the Lovable sandbox. Specifically, `React.useEffect`—valid during initialization—mutated to `null` after mount, causing crashes within `@tanstack/react-query`. The issue was traced using Tier 4 COTC runtime validators.

---

## Timeline

* **T+0s** – React application initializes, `useEffect` is valid
* **T+45–90s** – `useEffect` mutates to `null`
* **T+diagnostic** – Error emerges in React Query hooks
* **T+postmortem** – COTC runtime validators isolate corruption

---

## Problem Statement

React's hook internals were mutating mid-session inside Lovable's sandbox environment—an issue never observed in production or local development.

**Key Findings:**

* `React.useEffect` was valid pre-mount
* Hook reference changed to `null` post-mount
* Crashes emerged without dynamic interaction
* Fault was reproducible in Lovable sandbox only

## Environment Table

| Environment      | React Hook Validity | Notes                                               |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Local Dev (Vite) | ✅ Stable            | No mutation observed                                |
| Vercel Prod      | ✅ Stable            | No mutation observed                                |
| Lovable Sandbox  | ❌ Corrupted         | `useEffect` = `null` after 74s (avg), no user input |

## Diagnostic Tools (COTC Tier 4)

COTC runtime validators were used to confirm corruption:

* `validateReactRuntime()` – startup sanity check
* `startReactRuntimeMonitoring()` – interval + animation frame validator
* `createImportCorruptionDetector()` – detects ref hijack post-import
* `ShadowValidator` – lifecycle-embedded runtime integrity check

```ts
export function startReactRuntimeMonitoring() {
  const originalUseEffect = React.useEffect;
  
  setInterval(() => {
    if (React.useEffect !== originalUseEffect) {
      throw new Error('TIER_1_VIOLATION: useEffect reference corrupted');
    }
  }, 1000);
  
  // Animation frame validator for high-frequency checks
  const checkFrame = () => {
    if (React.useEffect === null || React.useEffect === undefined) {
      throw new Error('TIER_0_VIOLATION: Critical hook mutation detected');
    }
    requestAnimationFrame(checkFrame);
  };
  requestAnimationFrame(checkFrame);
}
```

## Contract Implementation

The React Runtime Contract (D6) was developed to catch this class of failures:

```json
{
  "contract_id": "runtime.react.v1",
  "constraints": [
    {
      "field": "hook_integrity",
      "type": "presence",
      "violation_tier": 1,
      "required": true
    },
    {
      "field": "import_corruption",
      "type": "presence", 
      "violation_tier": 0,
      "required": true
    }
  ],
  "tiers": {
    "0": {
      "name": "Critical Runtime Corruption",
      "action": "Throw error and halt execution"
    },
    "1": {
      "name": "Hook Reference Drift",
      "action": "Log warning and attempt recovery"
    }
  }
}
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Hypotheses (Unconfirmed)

* **Module federation failure** - Webpack module loading corrupts React exports
* **Web worker scope leak** - Background processes overwrite global references
* **Transpilation issue** - Lovable's build pipeline modifies React internals
* **Shadow DOM collision** - Preview environment conflicts with hook context

### Evidence Collected

* Issue only occurs in Lovable's sandboxed preview environment
* Timing is consistent (45-90 seconds post-mount)
* No user interaction required to trigger corruption
* Local and production environments remain stable

---

## COTC Validation Success

**Key Achievement:** COTC Tier 4 validators successfully detected runtime corruption that would otherwise be invisible until catastrophic failure.

**Detection Methods:**
1. **Startup validation** - Confirmed hooks were valid at initialization
2. **Continuous monitoring** - Caught the exact moment of corruption
3. **Shadow validation** - Provided redundant integrity checking

**Business Impact:**
* Prevented silent failures in user applications
* Enabled root cause investigation with precise timing data
* Demonstrated COTC's value for runtime integrity monitoring

---

## Lessons Learned

* **Runtime corruption can be environment-specific** and may not manifest in development
* **COTC Tier 4 validators provide essential visibility** into infrastructure-level failures
* **Contract-based monitoring** enables precise failure classification and response
* **Proactive validation** prevents silent corruption from becoming catastrophic failure
